# Binary Tree with D-mail

This is a combination of the binary tree concept and Steins;Gate's `D-mail` concept.

I just thought of it out of boredom during an insomnia.

Maybe it has something to do with quantum mechanics :-)

## What is Steins;Gate?

[Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins;Gate_(TV_series)>)

## Principle

This program will randomly generate a binary tree. Different from the general binary tree, it will generate a `D-mail` sent to the past at a random node.

The binary tree that received the D-mail will flip its value and regenerate the subtree.

This will cause the world line to change. And Okabe Rintaro will trigger his own `Reading Steiner`.

## Usage

Just `python main.py`
